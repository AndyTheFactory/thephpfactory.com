## Get in Touch (or Don't)

Hey there! If you’ve found yourself on this page, you’re either:

1. Trying to find some joomla project we developed.
2. Wanting to get some support (sorry, we're dead).
3. Just clicking buttons to see what happens (a valid life strategy).

Either way, here’s how you can contact me:

### Email Me
Drop me an email at **[hello@thephpfactory.com](mailto:hello@thephpfactory.com)**. I promise to reply faster than your grandma does to your text messages (but slower than a bot spamming your inbox).

### Stalk Me on GitHub
Want to see some semi-coherent code, questionable commits, or the cemetery of our old code? Head over to **[GitHub](https://github.com/AndyTheFactory)**. I can’t promise it’s all good, but it’s all there.
