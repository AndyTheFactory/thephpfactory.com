And there you have it — a collection of projects that reflect years of code, creativity, and probably more debugging sessions than I’d like to admit. These are not just components; they’re little pieces of my soul, wrapped in PHP and Joomla magic.

If you find these useful, great! If not, that’s okay too—just don’t tell me; my fragile coder heart can only take so much.

But seriously, thank you for stopping by. Whether you’re here to download, contribute, or just silently judge my work, I appreciate you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll be off building my next masterpiece (or crying into my coffee because someone found a bug).

*Sleep tight, my little projects. May you live forever in someone else’s `htdocs` folder.*
